### Uku's learnings

- Manages cool design system called [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/). Interestingly they have React, Angular, Vue and Vanilla JS examples
  - Great documentation, a lot to learn from them
- It is foolish to expect "Work done" after building your design system, in reality one has even more work to do once it is live
- Build a process
  - Create issue templates system that allows to efficiently communicate issues (desc., feature or bug, reproduce steps, browser, version, screenshots)
    - They use Github to manage their system
  - Code of conduct - Be respectful, understanding, courteous, welcoming — so basically not a-hole
    - Create a document to write everything down in simple format
  - How to enforce design system
    - If you see something, contact the exact person who is creating trouble
    - Component check-ins - see how designers and developers are using your system
- Design systems shouldn't be mandated, instead use these tricks
  - Be always available for people who need help
  - Provide all the docs in a simple format (Getting started, Migration guide, Component usage guidelines)
    - Even non-designers and non-devs need to understand these docs (why? because marketing and PMs will also start using it soon)
  - Promote the value (show-off time after time)
  - Overcommunicate (e.g., updates, achievements)
- Maintenance
  - Get issue reporters to contribute bug fixes as well (provide good documentation)
  - Contribution levels:
    - Heavy - adding new component
    - Medium - changing guidelines, adding icons
    - Light - small change or tweak
  - Hahaha, data tables are hard!! I agree
  - Plan for refactors whenever you release new component, first version is almost never good enough
- Strategy
  - Have a roadmap for the future
  - Focus on product team needs (this helps you prioritize based on what you need soon vs what you might need in 1 year)
  
Very practical talk that reminded me important aspects and teached me how such a big design system like Carbon is actually managed. Good stuff!

### Villem's learnings

Governance - how to make people use the design system?

- Reporting issues very clear, the designer know what are the technical details that have to be in the issue report before he/she goes to the technical team. Probably very obvious to a company where there’s a whole team that is only working on the design system.

- This governance issue seems like a bigger deal in bigger companies, but we actually already see it with AIA developments. Can imagine what it’s like to make a design system for whole teams of product designers to use.

Adoption- people actually start using the system

- Design systems shouldn’t be mandated. They should be a set of tools that makes other peoples lives easier.

- Be available, provide documentation, show value (decrease inconsistencies, better accessibility, page performance etc.), overcommunicate = BUILDING TRUST.

Designing data tables is hard :D Stress testing and communicating with the product teams. 

First see what are all the needs that exist, from our product teams side. Involve them in critiques and get them to poke holes in the designs.
