# You've Built a Design System - Now What? by Bethany Sonefeld

### Uku's learnings

- Manages cool design system called [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/). Interestingly they have React, Angular, Vue and Vanilla JS examples
  - Great documentation, a lot to learn from them
- It is foolish to expect "Work done" after building your design system, in reality one has even more work to do once it is live
- Build a process
  - Create issue templates system that allows to efficiently communicate issues (desc., feature or bug, reproduce steps, browser, version, screenshots)
    - They use Github to manage their system
  - Code of conduct - Be respectful, understanding, courteous, welcoming â€” so basically not a-hole
    - Create a document to write everything down in simple format
  - How to enforce design system
    - If you see something, contact the exact person who is creating trouble
    - Component check-ins - see how designers and developers are using your system
- Design systems shouldn't be mandated, instead use these tricks
  - Be always available for people who need help
  - Provide all the docs in a simple format (Getting started, Migration guide, Component usage guidelines)
    - Even non-designers and non-devs need to understand these docs (why? because marketing and PMs will also start using it soon)
  - Promote the value (show-off time after time)
  - Overcommunicate (e.g., updates, achievements)
- Maintenance
  - Get issue reporters to contribute bug fixes as well (provide good documentation)
  - Contribution levels:
    - Heavy - adding new component
    - Medium - changing guidelines, adding icons
    - Light - small change or tweak
  - Hahaha, data tables are hard!! I agree
  - Plan for refactors whenever you release new component, first version is almost never good enough
- Strategy
  - Have a roadmap for the future
  - Focus on product team needs (this helps you prioritize based on what you need soon vs what you might need in 1 year)
  
Very practical talk that reminded me important aspects and teached me how such a big design system like Carbon is actually managed. Good stuff!
