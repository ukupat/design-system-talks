### Uku's learnings

- Be specific about what you want to achieve with developing the design system (not just consistency and efficency)
- Understand every user (e.g., designers, developers) of the design system what are their needs that need serving
- Creates safety space and time for your system users and builders to express their needs, opinions and give feedback (e.g., Wins and Frustrations meetup)
- "Let go of ideal solutions, and design for the problems you actually have with the bandwidth you actually have"
- When people are using the system incorrectly then what causes it really? Is it lack of documentation or what? Don't police people without trying to solve the underlying issue.
