### Uku's learnings

- Be specific about what you want to achieve with developing the design system (not just consistency and efficency)
- Understand every user (e.g., designers, developers) of the design system what are their needs that need serving
- Creates safety space and time for your system users and builders to express their needs, opinions and give feedback (e.g., Wins and Frustrations meetup)
- "Let go of ideal solutions, and design for the problems you actually have with the bandwidth you actually have"
- When people are using the system incorrectly then what causes it really? Is it lack of documentation or what? Don't police people without trying to solve the underlying issue.

### Villem's learnings

- People part of design systems- human collaborators are most valuable but also produce inevitable conflicts and errors.
- Design systems are sustainable when collaborators (designer, developers etc.) needs & desires are served. Each of those agents needs to feel safe to advocate their needs & desires. Those discussions also determine the scope of your design system.
- Create safe space for expressing wins and frustrations.
- Let go of ideal solutions when building a design system. Figma is a good tool to already work and document at the same time. Doesn't have to be a separate webpage or something set in stone.
- Experiment, communicate and document. (I don't know in what order:D)

Overall a bit messy talk as I didn't get what is her exact job and who are their clients. Do they have those frustration and wins meetings with their clients or inside their own team. Didn't really get the painpoints other than deisgn systems that don't take into account all the people that are using it will inevitably fail and we should take it into account and collaborat, but also prepare for those failures.
